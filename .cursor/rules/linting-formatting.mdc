# React Quality Checks

## Mandatory Post-Edit Verification

Whenever you update **React**, **TypeScript**, or **JavaScript** files, you **must** run and fix any issues before completing the task.

The following checks are mandatory:

- **ESLint**  
  Run the project linter and resolve all reported issues.

- **Prettier**  
  Ensure code formatting passes. Use `--write` for any files that were edited.

These steps must be performed **automatically after every edit**.  
Do not wait for the user or reviewer to remind you.

## Required Commands (industry-verticals)

From the project root:

```bash
cd industry-verticals/luxury-retail
npm run lint
npx prettier --write "path/to/edited/files"
